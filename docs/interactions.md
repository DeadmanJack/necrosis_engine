Noita's element interactions are a cornerstone of its chaotic and emergent gameplay! While there isn't one single "official" chart from the developers (as interactions can be complex and sometimes surprising), we can definitely create a comprehensive markdown table covering the most common and impactful liquid, gas, and state interactions.

This table will look at how two different elements react when they come into contact. Keep in mind:
*   **Symmetry:** `Water vs Lava` is generally the same as `Lava vs Water`. I'll fill in both sides for completeness.
*   **Context:** The environment, amount of material, and specific modifiers (perks, wands) can affect outcomes. This table covers general interactions.
*   **"No Direct Reaction":** Means they mostly coexist or pass through each other without transforming.

### Other Notable Liquids & Their Interactions:

Noita has many other liquids and gases with unique properties! Here are a few that don't easily fit into the general interaction grid, but are crucial:

*   **Berserkium:** Causes anyone (including you) to go berserk and attack anything. No direct liquid-liquid interactions besides mixing.
*   **Pheromone:** Charms enemies, making them non-hostile and often attack other enemies. No direct liquid-liquid interactions besides mixing.
*   **Teleportatium (Normal & Unstable):** Instantly teleports you on contact. Normal is predictable, Unstable is random. No direct liquid-liquid interactions besides mixing.
*   **Concentrated Mana:** Refills mana. No major chemical interactions.
*   **Midas (Alchemic Precursor):** Turns almost anything into gold if it touches enough of it. Can be mixed with other liquids.
*   **Swamp / Mud / Sand:** Generally less reactive than the core elements. Mud and swamp can mix with water. Sand reacts to explosions by dispersing.
*   **Poison Gas / Cloud of Poison:** Inflicts poison status effect. Interacts with fire by burning away, and steam by dispersing.
*   **Freezing Vapors:** Freezes anything it touches, turning liquids into ice.
*   **Chili:** Inflicts burning status, and can ignite oil or other flammables.

This table should give you a great overview of the fundamental chemical reactions and physical interactions you'll encounter in Noita! Good luck, and try not to explode yourself (too often).
